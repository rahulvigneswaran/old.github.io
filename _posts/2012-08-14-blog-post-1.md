Every drone that we see today, however small it may be, is processing some kind of complex control algorithm beneath its skin. To design such control algorithms that enable things like the basic attitude of a quadcopter to robustness in highly complex scenarios is possible only if we have a deeper understanding of how it functions. A very important step towards it is creating a mathematical model of it that has the essence of its dynamics. In this post, I have studied the dynamics of a quadrotor with certain assumptions and expressed them as a state-space model.
