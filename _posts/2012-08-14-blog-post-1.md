Every drone that we see today, however small it may be, is processing some kind of complex control algorithm beneath it's skin. To design such control algorithms that enables things like basic attitude of a quadcopter to robustness in highly complex scenarios, is possible only if we have a deeper understanding of how it functions. A very important step towards it is creating a mathematical model of it that has the essence of it's dynamics. In this post, I have studied the dynamics of a quadrotor with certain assumptions and expressed them as state-space model.
