excerpt: 'This article is in continuation of my [previous blog](https://raghavsomani.github.io/posts/2018/04/blog-post-4/), and discusses about a section of the work by [Jeffery Z. HaoChen and Suvrit Sra 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10077.pdf){:target="_blank"}, in which the authors come up with a non-asymptotic rate of $$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T^2} + \frac{n^3}{T^3} \right)$$ for Random Shuffling Stochastic algorithm which is strictly better than that of SGD.'

This article is in continuation of my [previous blog](https://raghavsomani.github.io/posts/2018/04/blog-post-4/){:target="_blank"}, and discusses about a section of the work by [Jeffery Z. HaoChen and Suvrit Sra 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10077.pdf){:target="_blank"}, in which the authors come up with a non-asymptotic rate of $$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T^2} + \frac{n^3}{T^3} \right)$$ for Random Shuffling Stochastic algorithm which is strictly better than that of SGD. The article talks about the simple case when the objective function is a sum of quadratic functions where with a fixed step-size and after a reasonable number of epochs, we can guarentee a faster rate for Random Shuffling.
