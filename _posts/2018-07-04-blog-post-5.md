excerpt: 'This article is on the work by [Défossez and Bach 2014](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.0156.pdf){:target="_blank"}, in which the authors develop an operator view point for analyzing Averaged SGD updates to show the Bias-Variance Trade-off and provide tight convergence rates of Least Mean Squared problem.'
