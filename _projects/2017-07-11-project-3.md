We provide a formulation of empirical bayes described by Atchad√© (2011) to tune the hyperparameters of priors used in Bayesian set up of collaborative filter.

We implement the same in MovieLens small dataset. We see that it can be used to get a good initial choice for the parameters. It can also be used to guess an initial choice for hyper-parameters in grid search procedure even for the datasets where MCMC oscillates around the true value or takes long time to converge.
